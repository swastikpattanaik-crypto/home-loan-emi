HOME LOAN ADVISOR
=================

Problem Statement
-----------------
Many applicants struggle to understand whether they qualify for a home loan and what type of lender or interest rate they might receive. Banks and financial institutions use several criteria such as CIBIL score, income stability, debt burden, age, and employment history, but these are not always clear to users.  
This project attempts to provide a simple tool that gives an approximate idea of loan approval chances, possible lender category, and estimated EMI.

Scope of the Project
--------------------
The program builds a heuristic score based on commonly checked loan parameters.  
It does not replicate any real bank’s underwriting system and is not meant to be a financial authority.  
The model is purely for educational purposes and is intended to show how different factors affect a loan decision.

The user inputs financial and personal details, and the advisor produces:
- an internal score  
- a recommended lender type  
- a possible interest rate range  
- an estimated EMI  
- basic repayment suggestions  

The entire program runs from the console and uses simple Python logic.

Target Users
------------
- Students learning Python and financial calculations  
- Beginners trying to understand basic loan evaluation concepts  
- Individuals wanting a rough idea of EMI and loan eligibility  
- Users interested in how credit factors influence lending decisions
